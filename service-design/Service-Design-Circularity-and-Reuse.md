# Service Design - Circularity and Reuse

Design services for circularity can reduce software's environmental impact through re-use.

For example, designing for future extensibility and ease of integration means more people are likely to consider adopting your common solution than creating their own version.

## The main ideas in this section

**Backwards compatibility**: By making your solutions compatible with older versions and avoiding changes that break the functionality of existing systems, you can prolong the lifespan of current capabilities, hardware, and software. This is a key way to prevent unintended obsolescence.

**Communities of Practice**: A community of practice has a common goal and make your technologies compatible across projects, even those that are not related to a common cause

**Working in the Open**: You open up access to source code, use Open Data, Standards and Interfaces, and maintain documentation and getting started guides to make code re-use easier.

### For 1 point

**Backwards Compatibility**: We align with current standards, software and devices available at the time of building software. We don't tend to undertake end-user device testing beyond using emulators to prove it works with with most common user configurations.

**Communities of Practice**: Sharing of approaches, solutions and patterns tends to be informal and organic. There is no concentrated effort to encourage re-use and sharing within the organisation.

**Working in the Open**: Our source code is available within the organisation though the documentation tends to be written to be consumed within our team. We try to align with open standards/data when we can.

### For 3 points

**Backwards Compatibility**: We align with current standards, software and devices available at time of software creation and within the last 3 years. We undertake a limited amount of end-user device testing with the most common user configurations to prove compatibility. Where an incompatibility becomes known it is treated as a bug and triaged/prioritised as high.

**Communities of Practice**: There is organisational support to facilitate the sharing of approaches, solutions and patterns; forums and mechanisms exist for teams to share with one another with possible examples of this happening.

**Working in the Open**: Our source code is available within the organisation, documentation is written from the perspective that it will be used throughout the organisation with at least a getting started guide. We align with open standards/data.

### For 5 points

**Backwards Compatibility**: We align with current standards, software and devices available at time of software creation and within the last 5 years. We undertake end-user device testing with the most common user configurations to prove compatibility. Where an incompatibility becomes known it is treated as a bug and triaged/prioritised as high.

**Communities of Practice**: There is organisational support to facilitate the sharing of approaches, solutions and patterns; forums and mechanisms exist for teams to share with one another. This happens consistently with communities formed to support these mechanisms and drive forward common themes.

**Working in the Open**: Our source code is available within the organisation. We align with open standards/data with services designed for ease of integration and extensibility. Documentation is written from the perspective that it will be used throughout the organisation with clear getting started, contribution and issue-raising guidelines.
