# Service Design - Requirements

You donâ€™t need to make software that is not necessary.

You can avoid waste by questioning the requirements and making sure you really need a new feature before you start developing it.

You should test your needs quickly, using evidence from user feedback and data to prove the value of your products, services, or features.

## The main ideas in this section

**Ideation**: Ideally you'll want open forums where anyone on your team or beyond can suggest ideas for improvement.

**Challenge**: Do you question the need for the changes you are asked to make? Do you have a good reason to build the feature or to meet the SLAs/NFRs? Do you feel comfortable to challenge something that someone higher up has told you is needed?

**User-Centric**: How do you gather user needs when undertaking new work to avoid building something on based on assumptions?

**Iteration**: How quickly can you go from an idea to working software that you can show to user to get feedback?

## For 1 point

**Ideation**: Tends to come from architects/product owners or the client; the involvement of our team is minimal.

**Challenge**: Tends to come from the more senior members of our team, if at all.

**User-Centric**: Feedback on new features is only sought after our team has built them.

**Iteration**: We can go from new requirements to working software/getting feedback in months.

### For 3 points

**Ideation**: Comes from all team members through open design decisions.

**Challenge**: Structured process and integrated into refinement. All our team members challenge assumptions around NFRs and SLAs.

**User-Centric**: We are able to quickly qualify the need for new features rapidly through qualitative and quantitative user research

**Iteration**: We can go from new requirement to working software/getting feedback in weeks.

### For 5 points

**Ideation**: Comes from all our team members through open design decisions and from the user community.

**Challenge**: Structured process and integrated into refinement. Comes from all our team members and with external stakeholders support to challenge business assumptions around NFRs and SLAs.

**User-Centric**: We are able to quickly qualify the need for new features rapidly through qualitative and quantitative user research methods

**Iteration**: We can go from new requirements to working software/getting feedback in days"
