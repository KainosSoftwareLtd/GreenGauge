# Service Design - Business Model

Create a sustainable business model to promote eco-friendly practices and help guard against greenwashing.

For example, if your product operates a subscription-based model, you might encourage energy-efficient usage through tiered pricing by carbon impact.

## The main ideas in this section

**Business Model**: A sustainable business model extends the standard Business Model Canvas to include End of Life plans as well as a list of possible negative effects and plans to minimise or mitigate them.

**Charging Model**: Many industries have adapted charging models which prioritise responsible use of their services e.g. charging more when demand is higher or less when demand is low, could the same apply to carbon intensity for electricity? How are you using this to influence your thinking?

**Reporting Transparency**: How openly do you track and report on the environmental impact of your service, and the impact of the resources you consume in delivering and operating the service?

### For 1 point

**Business Model**: In defining the business model, little or no consideration has been given to the potential negative effects of the solution, as well as what happens at the end of the product lifecycle and whether the product can be profitably reused or sunset (End of Life)

**Charging Model**: We equalise our costs across customers/consumers to offer a one-size fits all approach. We can offer volume based discounts.

**Reporting Transparency**: We do not track or make known the environmental impact of our software or the impacts users incur through using our software.

### For 3 points

**Business Model**: The potential negative effects of the solution have been discussed but not documented or incorporated in the the service definition, while End of Life decisions have been postponed for when the solution goes live.

**Charging Model**: We offer a predictable, tiered pricing model where we encourage more efficient usage through financial incentives e.g. continuously increasing the cost for archived data the longer it is stored for.

**Reporting Transparency**: We track and report at an organisational level e.g. the impact our organisation is having and how we are changing our business and mitigating those impacts.

### For 5 points

**Business Model**: The potential negative effects of the product have been documented and incorporated in the service definition. There is a plan for how you can profitably reused or sunset the solution.

**Charging Model**: We offer a dynamic pricing model where we vary our pricing and incentives based on prevailing circumstances at the time. For example, we can increase/reduce spot pricing for our service based on the availability of low-carbon energy.

**Reporting Transparency**: We track and report environmental impact at a service level e.g. we can reason about the impact of each software service we offer and relate this to end users activities e.g. leveraging the Software Carbon Intensity methodology.
