# Service Design - Optimising User Journeys

You can save energy and resources by making user journeys simpler and faster.

Conway’s law says that organisations create systems that reflect how they communicate. For example, a digital application might still need a paper form to be printed so someone in the back office can sign and approve it.

You can use design thinking to rethink your digital products and services and avoid Conway’s law and the trap of ‘we've always done it this way’.

## The main ideas in this section

**Process automation**: Optimising processes once they start to cause you pain makes sense, but do you continuously review/optimise how things work to reduce waste/increase efficiency?

**Design thinking**: Improving your current methods has its limits; what if you could redesign the service to achieve the same goals but with more efficiency and user satisfaction?

**Accessibility**: The better you are able to accommodate people's needs within the service, the more likely they are to stay within it e.g. if a user needs to contact a support centre to understand how the service works or validate what something means then you've incurred waste. Aligning with standards including WCAG can help alleviate this.

### For 1 point

**Process Automation**: Once we observe bottlenecks in a process, we use automation to minimise those manual parts of the process to make it more efficient.

**Design Thinking**: We tend to optimise the existing process to make it more efficient than redesigning the whole process.

**Accessibility**: We apply WCAG (if at all) on a best-effort basis and target the lowest (A) rating.

### For 3 points

**Process Automation**: We have implemented a process of continuous optimisation where we systematically identify and mitigate process friction.

**Design Thinking**: We attempt to go back to the drawing board and rethink how we can better satisfy user needs without being tied to the existing software solution, but we tend to stick to the existing digital channels of the process.

**Accessibility**: We apply WCAG on a must-have basis and target an intermediate (AA) rating.

### For 5 points

**Process Automation**: We have implemented a process of continuous optimisation where we systematically identify and mitigate process friction. We actively garner feedback from service users to build our view from multiple perspectives.

**Design Thinking**: We adopt a whole service multi-channel view to how we optimise user journeys and make them more efficient e.g. digital, online and offline processes.

**Accessibility**: We apply WCAG on a must-have basis and target attainment the highest (AAA) rating.
