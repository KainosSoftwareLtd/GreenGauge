# Green Software Maturity Assessment

The aim of this document is to enable people to benchmark how green their software is on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best, for a variety of pillars which are subdivided into sections. You can find tables detailing what you need to do for each section in the links below:
