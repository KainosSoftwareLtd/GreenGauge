# Green software maturity assessment

The Green software maturity assessment is intended to be a self-assessment tool enabling teams and organisations to identify tangible things they might change to improve their alignment with green principles, patterns, and processes.

### CMMI Approach

The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is framework often used to first benchmark and that guide a structured approach to process improvement. The CMMI maturity model consists of five levels, each representing a stage in an organization's maturity and capability in managing and executing its processes. 


1. Level 1: An initial state, where processes are often ad hoc and chaotic. 
2. Level 2: Managed processes indicate that some basic practices are in place. 
3. Level 3: Defined and standardised set of processes.
4. Level 4: Quantitatively managed processes.
5. Level 5: Continuously optimised processes.

Our interpretation of CMMI for this assessment is to define the states for Level 1, 3 and 5 across a number of pillars enabling rapid self-assessment against practices. Its not meant to be canonically correct, but to indicate by absence or presence of certain practices areas you might wish to focus on for improvement.

### Assessment Pillars
You will find the CMMI model for each of the pillars in the documents below

| Pillar | Description |
|---|---|
| [Architecture](architecture-matrix.md) | How the architecture you use can help reduce your carbon footprint. |
| [Measurement](measurement-matrix.md) | The ways you can measure your progress. |
| [Continuous Delivery](continuous-delivery-matrix.md) | How the way in which you build and run your software can help reduce your carbon footprint. |
| [Service Design](service-design-matrix.md) | How you can optimise the way you design your software and receive user feedback. |
| [User Experience](user-experience-matrix.md) | How you can optimise the user experience and also educate your users to make sustainable choices. |
| [Planning](planning-matrix.md) | How you can help carbon reduction at the planning stage. |
| [Culture](culture-matrix.md) | How you can encourage a positive culture both internally and externally. |
