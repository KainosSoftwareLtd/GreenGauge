# GreenGauge - Green software maturity assessment

Focusing on rapid self-assessment, we wanted to create a tool allowing people to quickly self-evaluate their teams or organisations practices to better identify things they might change to reduce the carbon impact of their software.

### CMMI Approach

The Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is framework often used to assess the maturity of things on a scale of 1 to 5. The first stage typically is to benchmark where you are, then using the framework to guide systematic improvements across areas. Each of the 5 levels of the CMMI then represents a stage in an organisation's maturity as identified below. 


1. **Level 1**: An initial state, where processes are often ad hoc and chaotic. 
2. **Level 2**: Managed processes indicate that some basic practices are in place. 
3. **Level 3**: Defined and standardised set of processes.
4. **Level 4**: Quantitatively managed processes.
5. **Level 5**: Continuously optimised processes.

Our interpretation of CMMI is to define the states for Levels 1, 3 and 5 across a number of pillars which we believe are integral to building greener softare. We've left Levels 2 and 4 undefined as transition states e.g. where you think you might not quite be a 3, but certainly better than 1. 

### Using this assessment
Work through each of the pillars and honestly assess your level of maturity relative to the descriptions in this handy scoring guide; fuzzyness is intended to keep things simple and you should apply the 'mostly' principle when considering your scores.

* If you mostly do something, you probably do it
* If you don't, then you probably don't

Utilise the transition levels of 2 and 4 where you believe you don't quite hit the brief.

Having done this average up your scores per pillar using this [assessment template](template/gg-assessment-template.xlsx) to plot them on a spider chart to understand relative maturity across the pillars and which areas you might wish to focus on for improvement going forward.

Repeat this benchmark every 3 months to track progress and review your improvement plans.

### Assessment Pillars
You will find the CMMI framework for each of the pillars in the links below

| Pillar | Description |
|---|---|
| [Architecture](docs/architecture-matrix.md) | How the architecture you use can help reduce your carbon footprint. |
| [Measurement](docs/measurement-matrix.md) | The ways you can measure your progress. |
| [Continuous Delivery](docs/continuous-delivery-matrix.md) | How the way in which you build and run your software can help reduce your carbon footprint. |
| [Service Design](docs/service-design-matrix.md) | How you can optimise the way you design your software and receive user feedback. |
| [User Experience](docs/user-experience-matrix.md) | How you can optimise the user experience and also educate your users to make sustainable choices. |
| [Planning](docs/planning-matrix.md) | How you can help carbon reduction at the planning stage. |
| [Culture](docs/culture-matrix.md) | How you can encourage a positive culture both internally and externally. |
