# Architecture - Design

Design your software with energy and hardware efficiency in mind.

This helps to optimise carbon impact both now and in the future.

Adopt modular, decoupled architectures to enable targeted changes or quick improvements.

## The main ideas in this section

**Architecture Guidance**: How do you assist people in architecting solutions aligned to green software principles? Do golden paths exist?

**Pattern Library**: Where can people discover previously implemented patterns or versions of good for solutions aligned with green software principles?

### For 1 point

**Architecture Guidance**: People draw on their own experience and what they can find on the internet to design what they think is right.

**Pattern Library**: Patterns are shared across informal employee networks

### For 3 points

**Architecture Guidance**: Guidance exists for how to deploy commonly utilised components in an energy/hardware efficient manner e.g. 12-factor apps.

**Pattern Library**: Patterns are stored/maintained by the architecture community.

### For 5 points

**Architecture Guidance**: There are guidelines based on scenarios that show the best way and the ideal steps to achieve results in a way that saves energy and hardware.

**Pattern Library**: A pattern library is actively contributed to and maintained across the organisation.
