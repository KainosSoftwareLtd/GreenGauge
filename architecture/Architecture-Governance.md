# Architecture - Governance

The way technology governance guides architecture and technology principles can have a big influence on how things are done and what results are achieved.

For instance, not only should you have some green software principles, but they need to be implemented and monitored by a green software governance framework.

## The main ideas in this section

**Decision Making**: What rules and processes do you use for making technology choices?

**Evaluation**: Which weighting do you apply to sustainability functional and non-functional requirements when making decisions? Do yoy apply a stronger weighting for vendors whom report on their own carbon impact and less for those that don't?

### For 1 point

**Decision Making**: We decide based on each situation and with the input of our peers. We try our best, but the views are subjective of the people involved.

**Evaluation**: Some consideration given to alternative options but these can prioritise functional rather than non-functional fit.

### For 3 points

**Decision Making**: New service delivery and change controls require consideration of carbon/environmental impact and the risks involved.

**Evaluation**: Consideration of alternatives spans functional and non-functional concerns.

### For 5 points

**Decision Making**: We use a strict method for delivering new services and making changes that requires us to base our decisions on data.

**Evaluation**: Consideration of alternatives spans functional and non-functional concerns with a clear framework in place.
