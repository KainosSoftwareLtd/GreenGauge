# User Experience - User education and behaviour

Users can also help by using software in an environmentally friendly way. You can teach them how to do this and reward them for their actions. For example, you can ask them if they need to run their task right away with a high carbon footprint of x CO<sub>2</sub>eq or if they can wait for three hours when the carbon impact will be lower at y CO<sub>2</sub>eq.

## The main ideas in this section

**Carbon Impact**: How do you represent the carbon impact of your software to end users using ratings like the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) score or carbon equivalences?

**Carbon Awareness**: How do you try to change user behaviour with this enhanced awareness of impact?

### For 1 point

**Carbon Impact**: We don't do anything explicit.

**Carbon Awareness**: We don't do anything explicit.

### For 3 points

**Carbon Impact**: We have calculated the Software Carbon Intensity for delivering a functional unit within the service.

**Carbon Awareness**: Having calculated the carbon impact, we provide carbon equivalences which users can better understand as well as guidance on how to mitigate some of the impact.

### For 5 points

**Carbon Impact**: We have calculated the Software Carbon Intensity for delivering a functional unit within the service and looked at the end-user impact of consuming the service end-to-end.

**Carbon Awareness**: Having calculated the end-to-end carbon impact, we provide carbon equivalences which users can better understand as well as guidance  on how to mitigate some of the impact. In some scenarios we recommend user-actions which can minimise carbon impact.
