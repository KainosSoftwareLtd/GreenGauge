# User Experience - Energy Efficient Defaults

"How we deliver services to users and allow them to personalise their experience provides opportunities to reduce energy impact.

For example, does it make sense to deliver an asset to the users device if it is never used? Do we really need autoplay enabled on the video or should we trust the user to click 'play' should they wish to view it?

## The main ideas in this section

**Reducing waste**: By definition, removing what is not used makes the solution more efficient e.g. removing unused assets or minifying files

**Media Optimisation**: How do you trade-off performance, experience and quality?  For example, do you make use of high quality video and colour photography, or do you opt for monochrome images and interactive web animations.

**Tweaking experience**: The provision of either context driven or user-based controls to alter the behaviour of the service e.g. disabling rich content like autoplay or tweaking the colour scheme

### For 1 point

**Reducing waste**: When we modify an existing service if there is obvious waste or improvements to be made, we'll try to make this without increasing the scope of the change. This happens on a best-effort basis.

**Media Optimisation**: We prioritise only the richness of the user experience. We opt for the highest quality images, videos and experiences without considering their impact.

**Tweaking experience**: Users can tweak their experience in basic ways like switching languages, but little focus on energy saving measures.

### For 3 points

**Reducing waste**: As part of our internal processes we have mechanisms to identify waste and raise it for consideration e.g. an unminified file, a sourced library that isn't used, an image which is included but not referenced. We utilise third-party tools to inspect our service and provide advice on energy efficient defaults.

**Media Optimisation**: We try to balance richness/quality with user experience pragmatism. We might generate assets in varying levels of quality and choose different defaults relative to the circumstances e.g. lower quality video or images when utilising a mobile phone or adoption of the WEBP image format.

**Tweaking experience**: We optimise the default experience and provide some basic options that could be used to reduce energy usage e.g. changing colour scheme.

### For 5 points

**Reducing waste**: As part of our internal processes we have mechanisms we use to identify waste and raise it for consideration e.g. an unminified file, a sourced library that isn't used, an image which is included but not referenced. We use third-party tools to inspect our service and provide advice on energy efficient defaults. The culture within our team is centred on reducing waste.

**Media Optimisation**: We generate assets in varying levels of quality enabling us to choose different defaults relative to the circumstances e.g. lower quality video or images when using a mobile phone.

**Tweaking experience**: We optimise all modes of user engagement and dynamically select the most energy efficient mode relative to how the user is accessing the service e.g. if the user is abroad we may disable videos.
