### Green software advocacy
You should bring green software practices into the heart of your company culture. Create a group of green software champions who work within your organisation to improve the adoption of green software patterns and practices.

| **Advocacy** | As a relatively new and emerging area, how are you supporting adoption and advocacy within your organisation? | We haven't really thought too much about it as Green Software is so new to us. | We have several very passionate engineers, architectures, product owners and other roles committed to making change and creating awareness within existing internal communities. | We have an established group of green software champions with a targeted plan to get this mindset into technology, product and other decision making. They are focused on coaching others in the use of green software principles, patterns and practices.                                            

### Leading change
Applying or retro-fitting green software patterns and practices across all areas of software development is not trivial and can be challenging. It requires interaction across multiple disciplines, adoption of new techniques and processes. Who is going to lead this change and who will motivate them?

| **Guiding Coalition** | A guiding coalition consists of multi-disciplinary service teams and Communities of practice and they work together to drive change and achieve a common goal. Working across groups is critical to leading the change we need to see with Green Software | Change tends to be personality driven by those that are really passionate around the topic - they don't tend to have a remit but encourage the right things to happen | A group within our organisation has developed a plan of action and are leading this change. Their remit is to increase awareness | A group within our organisation has developed a plan of action and are leading this change. Their remit is to encourage engagement from others and provide some steering within the organisation |
| **Incentives** | Without an incentive to engage with the guiding coalition, motivation will remain subjective to individuals. How do you reward green software advocates within your organisation today? | Nothing explicit, people driven by sense of passion. | People within the guiding coalition are given some space to develop this plan of action and to develop initiatives. | The business has a mechanism to invest and prioritise these activities alongside other high-priority delivery work. |

### Decision making 
Using the data you collect to influence your future decision making. Define how far and at what levels this is required within your organisation. Are you happy focusing only on technical disciplines, what about product owners, delivery managers and similar?

| **Data Driven** | Making eco-conscious decisions based on evidence, insights and informed analysis. | We look for available data sources to support our decisions but it often isn't available or mature enough. When data isn't available we'll make assumptions or educated guesses to plug the gaps. | We identify qualitative data-sources we need to make informed decisions and where this is not available we will plug the gap ourselves from publicly available data-sources and relevant techniques. We analyse historic data to inform our decisions. | We identify qualitative data-sources we need to make informed decisions and where this is not available we will plug the gap ourselves from publicly available data-sources and relevant techniques. We use historic data as a gauge, we apply predictive methods to the analysis to make inferences about the future. |

### Sharing
We can all learn from each otherâ€™s experiences, but only if we share successes and failures. Cultivating an open, inclusive culture around sharing and green software will help foster innovation and build momentum.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Sharing** | Your ability to share in success, learnings and failures is a measure of how psychologically safe people feel in your organisation and what barriers might stand in their way | Sharing happens at the edges; it tends to be the same people going out of their way to do it or facilitate it. It's not clear how staff would otherwise raise suggestions outside of their team or share ideas which could benefit the organisation through increased efficiency, waste reduction or increasing awareness | There is a staff ideas forum where things that have worked well within a team can be shared across the organisation. This is inclusive and provides a great way to share learnings beyond individuals | There is a staff ideas forum where things that have worked well within a team can be shared across the organisation. This is inclusive and provides a great way to share learnings beyond individuals. People feel psychological safe sharing failures |
| **Learning** | How do you learn from success (amplify impact) and respond to failure (change)? | We tend to share the successes we've had. | People feel safe sharing both successes and lessons learned from their experiences. | People feel safe sharing both successes and lessons learned from their experiences. |

### Shifting left
Shifting left refers to the practice of identifying and resolving issues as early as possible in the software development lifecycle. When done effectively, it places the person making the change in a position of responsibility for the change. How well are you educating your staff to interpret those feedback loops from a green software perspective and take responsible decisions?

| **Training** | How do you raise staff awareness around the impact of software on our environment and demystify the language? | We don't encourage or staff to undertake training in green software. | We encourage our staff to become certificated Green Software Practitioners and provide support for them to do this. | We require our staff to become certificated Green Software Practitioners and provide support for them to do this. |

### Code efficiency
Just because something works does not make it efficient. Optimising for efficiency and aspiring to achieve the outcome using the least resources possible is the ultimate goal of green software. It is the perennial trade-off between gained efficiency and lost productivity.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Best Practices** | How do you encourage 'leanness' and 'efficiency' in code which your developers create using techniques such as peer review | Efficiency is subjective to an individuals preference; working code is prioritised over efficient code. Code is only reviewed to improve efficiency when there is a performance problem | The peer review process provides recommendations to developers to optimise the efficiency of their solutions based on experience | The peer review process challenges developers on the efficiency of their solutions using an evidence from, for example, the results from NFR testing |
| **CodeGen** | How are you using advances In technology to interrogate and improve code efficiency | We sometimes use this to generate code. Some use it more than others. | During peer reviews, we encourage use of tools to interrogate the efficiency of our solutions and then improve it if we can. | We integrate with build tools that measures the efficiency of our code, checks for the implementation of green software patterns and provides recommendations for improvement. |
