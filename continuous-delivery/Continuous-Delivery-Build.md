# Continuous Delivery - Build

Reduce the carbon footprint by optimizing energy consumption in your build processes.

For example, in optimising the development environments allowing developers to catch/find problems sooner on their local machines, it means less wasted resources elsewhere in the lifecycle.

## The main ideas in this section

**Static Analysis**: There are now several mechanisms that can now measure carbon awareness in code - are you using such tools to identify improvements?

**Peer reviews**: Does your process interrogate the efficiency of the solution or does it just focus on the fact that it works? Do you have a 'green code review' guidance?

**CI/CD**: Have you optimised your build infrastructure to reduce its carbon footprint by reducing waste and improving efficiency?

### For 1 point

**Static Analysis**: We do static analysis, but we don't apply a green software lens to this.

**Peer Reviews**: Any changes we make require an approval where another member of the team has to review/approve changes.

**CI/CD**: We have dedicated CI/CD infrastructure with always-on build-agents.

### For 3 points

**Static Analysis**: We do static analysis and have enabled the green software scanners. There are lots of false positives, but we're working through this to find genuine improvements.

**Peer Reviews**: Any changes we make require an approval from a more senior member of the team with green software efficiency being prioritised.

**CI/CD**: We have dedicated CI/CD build infrastructure but build agents only get provisioned when there is work to do.

### For 5 points

**Static Analysis**: We do static analysis and have enabled the green software scanners. We've tuned our implementation of this to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.

**Peer Reviews**: As well as manual reviews and approvals, we have integrated automated tools to give us feedback on the efficiency of the code.

**CI/CD**: We make use of a SaaS hosted CI/CD solution where local build agents only get provisioned when there is work to do.
