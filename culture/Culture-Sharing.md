# Culture - Sharing

We can all learn from each otherâ€™s experiences, but only if we share successes and failures.

Cultivating an open, inclusive culture around sharing and green software will help foster innovation and build momentum.

## The main ideas in this section

**Sharing**: Your ability to share in success, learnings and failures is a measure of how psychologically safe people feel in your organisation and what barriers might stand in their way.

**Learning**: How do you learn from success (amplify impact) and respond to failure (change)?

### For 1 point

**Sharing**: Sharing happens at the edges; it tends to be the same people going out of their way to do it or facilitate it. It's not clear how staff would otherwise raise suggestions outside of their team or share ideas which could benefit the organisation through increased efficiency, waste reduction or increasing awareness.

**Learning**: We tend to share the successes we've had.

### For 3 points

**Sharing**: There is a staff ideas forum where things that have worked well within a team can be shared across the organisation. This is inclusive and provides a great way to share learnings beyond individuals.

**Learning**: People feel safe sharing both successes and lessons learned from their experiences.
