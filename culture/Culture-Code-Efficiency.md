# Culture - Code Efficiency

Just because something works does not make it efficient.

Optimising for efficiency and aspiring to achieve the outcome using the least resources possible is the ultimate goal of green software.

It is the perennial trade-off between gained efficiency and lost productivity.

## The main ideas in this section

**Best Practices**: How do you encourage 'leanness' and 'efficiency' in code which your developers create using techniques such as peer reviews

**CodeGen**: How are you using advances In technology to interrogate and improve code efficiency

### For 1 point

**Best Practices**: Efficiency is subjective to an individuals preference; working code is prioritised over efficient code. Code is only reviewed to improve efficiency when there is a performance problem.

**CodeGen**: We sometimes use this to generate code. Some use it more than others.

### For 3 points

**Best Practices**: The peer review process provides recommendations to developers to optimise the efficiency of their solutions based on experience.

**CodeGen**: During peer reviews, we encourage use of tools to interrogate the efficiency of our solutions and then improve it if we can.

### For 5 points

**Best Practices**: The peer review process challenges developers on the efficiency of their solutions using an evidence from, for example, the results from NFR testing.

**CodeGen**: We integrate with build tools that measures the efficiency of our code, checks for the implementation of green software patterns and provides recommendations for improvement.
