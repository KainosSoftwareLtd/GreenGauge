# Culture - Leading Change

Applying or retro-fitting green software patterns and practices across all areas of software development is not trivial and can be challenging. It requires interaction across multiple disciplines, adoption of new techniques and processes.

Who is going to lead this change and who will motivate them?

## The main ideas in this section

**Guiding Coalition**: A guiding coalition consists of multi-disciplinary service teams and Communities of practice and they work together to drive change and achieve a common goal. Working across groups is critical to leading the change we need to see with Green Software.

**Incentives**: Without an incentive to engage with the guiding coalition, motivation will remain subjective to individuals. How do you reward green software advocates within your organisation today?

### For 1 point

**Guiding Coalition**: Change tends to be personality driven by those that are really passionate around the topic - they don't tend to have a remit but encourage the right things to happen.

**Incentives**: Nothing explicit, people driven by sense of passion.

### For 3 points

**Guiding Coalition**: A group within our organisation has developed a plan of action and are leading this change. Their remit is to increase awareness.

**Incentives**: People within the guiding coalition are given some space to develop this plan of action and to develop initiatives.

### For 5 points

**Guiding Coalition**: A group within our organisation has developed a plan of action and are leading this change. Their remit is to encourage engagement from others and provide some steering within the organisation.
