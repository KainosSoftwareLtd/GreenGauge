# Planning - Business Alignment

By aligning your activities with your organizationâ€™s sustainability and net-zero goals, you can justify your roadmap and get your team and your client invested in it.

## The main ideas in this section

**Net-Zero**: How well aligned are you to any plans your organisation has to reduce its carbon impact? Do you know if there is a plan in place and the role you can have as part of this?

**Carbon Reduction**: If your organisation has a plan in place, how do you align with this? Do you need to think about tracking carbon in a specific way or establishing a carbon budget for the cost not just of running your products, but also the carbon cost of developing them?

### For 1 point

**Net-Zero**: We either don't have a corporate stance on this or we have no plan on how we align our service and its impacts to those plans.

**Carbon Reduction**: We align with best practices and try to reduce waste and be efficient where we can. We don't track carbon and haven't committed to any plans to reduce impact.

### For 3 points

**Net-Zero**: We have a corporate net-zero plan in place and we understand how our service impacts the Green House Gas Protocol (GHG) scopes 1, 2 and 3.

**Carbon Reduction**: We have committed to tracking our carbon impact aligned with the corporate reduction targets and identifying improvements in our service to deliver this.

### For 5 points

**Net-Zero**: We have a corporate net-zero plan in place. We understand how our service impacts GHG scopes 1,2 and 3 and understand how our own impact needs to develop to align with corporate targets.

**Carbon Reduction**: We have committed to tracking and reducing our carbon impact aligned with the corporate reduction targets. We have established governance within our team to ensure we deliver on these commitments.
