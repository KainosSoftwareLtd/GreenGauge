# Planning - Green Debt

Green debt, like technical debt, is all those things that we choose not to do now, but which will negatively impact the solution's carbon efficiency.

Tracking this debt ensures we can quantify the impact of potential improvements.

## The main ideas in this section

**Tracking**: How do you identify and track green debt?

**Remediation**: What are you going to do about it? How do you quantify the impact.

**Backlog**: Where does it live and how do you prioritise green debt amongst other backlog items?

### For 1 point

**Tracking**: We don't explicitly track technical debt from a green debt viewpoint. We tend to track technical debt for new decisions going forward.

**Remediation**: We resolve debt once it starts causing user-impacting problems for the service or becomes an obstacle for change.

**Backlog**: Where we track technical debt it is added to the backlog so we don't forget about it.

### For 3 points

**Tracking**: We identify technical debt both proactively and retroactively and link it to sustainability non-functional  requirements. For instance, we analyze how resolving the debt would affect these NFRs and therefore understand the benefits of fixing it.

**Remediation**: Teams are encouraged to adopt a balanced approach. Beyond feature delivery, our teams are expected to address items of technical debt (including green debt) as part of each iteration

**Backlog**: We have mechanisms in the backlog to identify items of technical debt which impact sustainability NFRs. We prioritise these amongst other technical debt items to ensure we are having as much impact as possible.

### For 5 points

**Tracking**: We identify technical debt both proactively and retroactively and link it to sustainability non-functional  requirements. For instance, we analyze how resolving the debt would affect these NFRs. We quantify the likely impact of remediating the debt.

**Remediation**: Like other practices including site-reliability engineering and error budgets, we have established a carbon budget which teams are targeted to spend to ensure we are making our services more efficient and waste less.

**Backlog**: We can easily identify items of green debt in the backlog and report on the anticipated benefits.
