# Measurement - KPIs

Defining and tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPI) aligned to your green software ambitions creates accountability and demonstrates the importance of measurement, tracking and impact.

Doing this provides clear feedback loops and the possibility for incentives based on what is going right, and what is not.

## The main ideas in this section

**Tracking**: If you aren't setting/defining Green Software KPIs against current initiatives then how do you articulate the importance of them and track benefit realisation aligned to them?

**Trend Analysis**: Are you analysing changes to identify trends, and then changing processes based on what is working and is not.

**Incentives**: How do you encourage people to engage with the process? Tracking another KPI which can be somewhat abstract may not be appealing by itself.

### For 1 point

**Tracking**: We do not set Green Software KPIs.

**Trend Analysis**: We don't track a lot of metrics so the impact of this is unknown.

**Incentives**: We don't provide many incentives to set or track green software KPIs.

### For 3 points

**Tracking**: We set Green Software KPIs but tracking can be ad-hoc.

**Trend Analysis**: We update the impact of changes periodically based on available data.

**Incentives**: We provide few incentives to set or track green software KPIs. They are not seen as important as other KPI's so tend to be de-prioritised."

### For 5 points

**Tracking**: We set Green Software KPIs with the same level of rigour/governance as other service KPI's.

**Trend Analysis**: We regularly update the impact of change and align it to reporting for other KPIs for the service.

**Incentives**: We prioritise Green Software KPIs similarly to other KPIs
