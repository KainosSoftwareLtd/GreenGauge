# Measurement - Benchmarking

What does "good" look like both within your organisation and relative to other organisations which are similar to yours? How do you establish a benchmark of good so you know if your ambitions are rooted in reality?

For example, have you established an internal leaderboard against your green software KPIs?

**Internally**: Internal benchmarking can be a useful way to create competition between your staff and an incentive for your staff to engage with green software.

**Externally**: External benchmarking can be a way for you to learn from others in Industry/community/Competitors/government on how to be better.
