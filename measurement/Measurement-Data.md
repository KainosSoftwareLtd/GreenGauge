# Measurement - Data

It's important that you can collect the data that allows you to understand and evaluate the environmental impact of your software.

Analysing this data over time allows you to use the historical data to support the need for any future changes or improvements.

## The main ideas in this section

**Full lifecycle**: The data required to understand the carbon impact of building, Developing, Operating and Usage the software. Do you collect all of this data today?

**Delivery**: The impact of creating the software in the first place, can you reason about cost of creation?

**Storage**: All this data needs to be stored somewhere, do you have a mechanism for this?

**Visualisation**: How easily can you access and analyse the data to create visualisations?

### For 1 point

**Full Lifecycle**: Some information is collected or derived from other sources on an ad-hoc basis.

**Delivery**: Whilst the data does exist, it can only be obtained on an adhoc basis.

**Storage**: Not centralised

**Visualisation**: Ad-hoc visualisations/carbon equivalencies are created with something like Excel spreadsheets instead of specialised visualisation tools.

### For 3 points

**Full Lifecycle**: Some areas are quite mature though others may be lacking e.g. we may have lots of data around build/deployment but little around usage.

**Delivery**: Data exists on centralised systems and can be extracted in reports.

**Storage**: Some data is centralised onto corporate systems, but stored in different formats.

**Visualisation**: Some dashboards created using point-in-time data.

### For 5 points

**Full Lifecycle**: Mature data collection across all areas to understand the full lifecycle.

**Delivery**: Data exists on centralised systems and can be integrated for real-time analysis.

**Storage**: Data is collected within centrally managed corporate systems that can be easily accessed via reports and programmatically.

**Visualisation**: Dashboards exist and make use of near real-time data.
