# Measurement - Carbon Proxies

Sometimes you won't have the data, it doesn't exist or can't get access to it. Using carbon proxies can help to plug these gaps with equivalencies.

Equivalencies work on the basis that you can make assumptions about one metric relative to the thing that you wish to track e.g. some key carbon proxies regarding cloud computing include cost and utilisation. As you spend more or less money with your cloud provider or as capacity within your solution is wasted,  your carbon impact will follow closely.

## The main perspectives in this section

**Resource perspective**: For each component (or combination of them within your solution) how well can you track information related to your consumption of them e.g. Cost, Utilisation, Storage size, Data Transfer volumes etc.

**Consumer perspective**: From the perspective of the service consumer there are tools that can help you identify what improvements can be made. For example there are website scanners that can provide feedback on Page weight / Server response times and similar.

### For 1 point

**Resource Perspective**: For each service you track/optimise costs and look at capacity planning for future growth around utilisation/storage/data transfer.

**Consumer Perspective**: You track request response times and some other basic metrics. Most of the information collection is server-side.

### For 3 points

**Resource Perspective**: You have identified some key metrics as carbon proxies e.g. cost as a measure of CO<sub>2</sub>e. You use these proxies to support decision making as required.

**Consumer Perspective**: You make use of real-user-monitoring or application performance management solutions providing detailed information on client-side telemetry. This lets you understand carbon proxies from the perspective of your users.

### For 5 points

**Resource Perspective**: You have identified several carbon proxies which are regularly tracked as part of your reporting and are used to influence decision making.

**Consumer Perspective**: You make use of real-user-monitoring or application performance management solutions providing detailed information on client-side telemetry. This lets you understand carbon proxies from the perspective of your users and these insights influence decision making.
