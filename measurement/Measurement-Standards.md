# Measurement - Standards

Once you have collected the data, it is important to apply industry techniques and standards to allow collaboration and create a common language for your reporting.

Adopting recognised standards like the Software Carbon Intensity Specification, creates a repeatable, scalable and predictable way of calculating the carbon impact of software.

## You should understand and check your alignment to the following standards

**GHG**: GreenHouse Gas Protocol

The GHG Protocol has 3 scopes:
1. Direct emissions
2. Indirect emissions from, for example, the electricity supply
3. Supply chain emissions

**SCI**: Software Carbon Intensity

SCI is a way to measure your rate of emissions. The more efficient your code is the lower your score will be. 

**FinOps**: The FinOps Foundation

### For 1 point

**GHG**: We are unaware of the scopes or significance

**SCI**: We are unaware of software carbon intensity specification or yet to apply it.

**FinOps**: We apply optimisations on an ad-hoc basis whenever its felt the bill is becoming too expensive.

### For 3 points

**GHG**: We have measured Scope 1 and 2 emissions and are actively seeking to reduce impacts.

**SCI**: We have completed a point-in-time calculation for SCI for a given service.

**FinOps**: We have completed an assessment with an action plan in place/being progressed to address findings.

### For 5 points

**GHG**: We have measured Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and are actively seeking to reduce impacts including through your supply chain.

**SCI**: We regularly calculate your SCI for a given service and use this to identify improvements/support decision-making.

**FinOps**: In addition to assessments, we focus on making sure that decision-making happens as early as possible in the process.
